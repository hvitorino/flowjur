# flowjur

A Clojure library designed to run clojure functions as part of a workflow. Each step
should have a name and a handler wich is a function of arity 1 designed to receive a
context hashmap used to read/store shared data throught all steps of the workflow.

## Usage

### Simple flow

```
(def right-foot 
  (step {:name    ::right-foot
         :handler (fn [ctx]
                    (assoc ctx :right-foot-data "right foot step"))))

(def left-foot 
  (step {:name    ::lef-foot
         :handler (fn [ctx]
                    (assoc ctx :left-foot-data "left foot step"))))

(defn handle-error [ctx]
  (println "Ouch!")
  (println (-> ctx :error :exception)))

(def run-forrest {:context       {}
                  :steps         [right-foot 
                                  left-foot 
                                  right-foot 
                                  left-foot]
                  :error-handler handle-error)

(flow run-forrest)
```
